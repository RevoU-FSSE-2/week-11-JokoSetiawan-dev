# Sellout Input Management API

The Sellout Input Management Backend API is a Node.js-based application designed to serve as the backend for a sellout input management system. It provides essential functionality for creating, managing, and tracking sellout.


## Key Features:

##### 1. User Authentication and Authorization:

- Secure user authentication and authorization system to control access to the API endpoints.

- Role-based access control for users, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interact with the system.


##### 2. Sellout Input Management:

- Create, update, and delete sellout.

##### 3. Database Integration:

- Utilize Mysql as the database to store transfer request data.

##### 4.API Documentation:

- Document the API endpoints using Swagger/OpenAPI for easy integration with frontend applications.


## Technology Stack:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: Mysql
API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI

## Running a Node.js Express API with TypeScript and MySQL Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your computer.
- MySQL server should be installed and running.


#### Step 1: Clone the Project

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-api-project.git`
`cd your-api-project`

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

`npm install`


#### Step 3: Configure the Database

- Ensure that your MySQL database is running.

- Open the config.ts (or similar) file in your project and specify the database connection details (host, username, password, database name, etc.).

#### Step 4: Create the Database Tables

- If your project uses a relational database, you may need to create the necessary tables.


#### Step 5: Build the TypeScript Code (if applicable)

If your project is using TypeScript, you might need to transpile the TypeScript code to JavaScript. Run the following command: `tsc`


#### Step 6: Start the API Server

`npm run dev`

Your Express.js API server should now be running locally. By default, it will likely be accessible at http://localhost:3000 unless you specified a different port in your configuration.

#### Step 7: Test Your API

Use a tool like Postman or a web browser to send HTTP requests to your local API server. Make sure to test various endpoints and verify that your API behaves as expected.

#### Step 8: Debugging and Monitoring
If you encounter any issues or errors, use debugging tools and check the logs to identify and resolve problems in your TypeScript code.

#### Step 9: Documentation
Ensure that you have comprehensive documentation for your API, including information on available endpoints, request/response formats, and any authentication requirements. You can use tools like Swagger to generate API documentation automatically.

#### Step 10: Security
Implement security measures such as input validation, authentication, and authorization to protect your API. Also, consider using environment variables to store sensitive information securely.

#### Step 11: Cleanup
When you're done testing your API, you can stop the server by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.
